;; BASE SETUP METAFUNCTIONS
;; =============================================================================

;; The core BOTC rule: given number of players, what's the base distribution?
(define-metafunction BOTC
  base-setup : num -> distribution
  ;; 5 players: 3 Townsfolk, 0 Outsiders, 1 Minion, 1 Demon
  [(base-setup 5) (dist (Townsfolk 3) (Outsider 0) (Minion 1) (Demon 1))]
  ;; 6 players: 3 Townsfolk, 1 Outsider, 1 Minion, 1 Demon  
  [(base-setup 6) (dist (Townsfolk 3) (Outsider 1) (Minion 1) (Demon 1))]
  ;; 7 players: 5 Townsfolk, 0 Outsiders, 1 Minion, 1 Demon
  [(base-setup 7) (dist (Townsfolk 5) (Outsider 0) (Minion 1) (Demon 1))]) 

;; Helper: extract count for a specific role type from distribution
(define-metafunction BOTC
  get-count : distribution role-type -> num
  ;; Notice how we use our declared pattern variables n_t, n_o, n_m, n_d!
  [(get-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) Townsfolk) n_t]
  [(get-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) Outsider) n_o]
  [(get-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) Minion) n_m]
  [(get-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) Demon) n_d])

;; Helper: update count for a specific role type
(define-metafunction BOTC
  update-count : distribution role-type num -> distribution
  [(update-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) 
                 Townsfolk n_new)
   (dist (Townsfolk n_new) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d))]
  [(update-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) 
                 Outsider n_new)
   (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_new) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d))]
  [(update-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) 
                 Minion n_new)
   (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_new) (Demon n_d))]
  [(update-count (dist (Townsfolk n_t) (Outsider n_o) (Minion n_m) (Demon n_d)) 
                 Demon n_new)

;; =============================================================================
;; STEP 2 QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
;; =============================================================================

;; 1. Look at the `get-count` metafunction. Can you see how the pattern variables
;;    n_t, n_o, n_m, n_d work? What would happen if we hadn't declared `[n ::= natural]`?
;;
;; 2. What BOTC game mechanic does the `update-count` function enable us to model?
;;    Hint: Think about roles that change the base distribution...
;;
;; 3. Try adding the base setup rule for 8 players (5 Townsfolk, 1 Outsider, 1 Minion, 1 Demon)
;;    to the `base-setup` metafunction above!
