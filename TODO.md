# Blood on the Clocktower DSL - TODO List

## Current Status
- **Main Branch**: `main` - stable SAT-based bag validation system
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/ascii-grimoire-hybrid-spacing` - ASCII grimoire rendering development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-20
- **Core System**: ‚úÖ Working SAT-based bag validation with Baron & Drunk roles
- **New Feature**: ‚úÖ ASCII grimoire rendering with hybrid spacing algorithm and role abbreviations

## üö® HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES, REGRESSIONS & IMPLEMENTATION GAPS

**Status**: Critical issues found during testing, including items previously marked complete but never properly implemented

**Validation Strategy Gap**: Several features were marked "‚úÖ complete" without sufficient end-to-end testing to verify actual working functionality. This highlights need for more rigorous validation before marking items as done.

### ASCII Grimoire Rendering Issues
**Priority**: HIGH | **Impact**: Visual correctness | **Test Cases**: `src/tests/render-grimoire-cases.test.ts`

1. **üêõ BUG #7: Left Side Positioning Never Implemented Correctly**
   - **Issue**: Left side players appear below bottom row instead of on proper clockwise arc
   - **Previous Status**: ‚úÖ Marked complete ("Left-side player placement - complete four-sided layout support")
   - **Reality**: Feature was never properly implemented, marking as complete was premature
   - **Test Case**: 6-player `[Alice:investigator Bob:chef Charlie:empath Dave:librarian Eve:butler *Frank:imp*]`
   - **Expected**: Dave ‚Üí Frank ‚Üí Eve ‚Üí Alice clockwise arc
   - **Actual**: Frank and Eve appear below Dave/Charlie/Bob row
   - **Location**: `src/rendering/ascii-grimoire.ts` left side positioning logic

2. **üêõ BUG #8: Dead Player Visual Indicators Missing**
   - **Issue**: Dead players (marked with `*dead*` in input) show no visual indication in ASCII output
   - **Test Case**: Harold marked as `*Harold:imp*` but renders identically to alive players
   - **Impact**: Critical game state information (alive/dead) not visually represented
   - **Parser Status**: ‚úÖ Correctly parses dead status, ‚ùå ASCII rendering ignores it

3. **üêõ BUG #9: Layout Selection Affected by Visual Formatting**
   - **Issue**: Auto layout selection may change based on visual formatting (dead indicators, etc.) rather than logical structure
   - **Risk**: Same logical grimoire could select different layouts based on alive/dead status
   - **Impact**: Layout "optimality" based on visual appearance instead of player positioning logic
   - **Status**: Needs concrete test case development and investigation

### Token Rendering Issues
4. **üêõ Token Rendering Inconsistency**
   - **Issue**: Some tokens not appearing in rendered output (Alice's `ww:townsfolk` missing while Bob's `lib:outsider` shows)
   - **Test Case**: `[Alice:washerwoman(ww:townsfolk) Bob:librarian(lib:outsider) *Charlie:imp*]`
   - **Status**: Inconsistent token placement in bubble column system

### Edge Case Handling
5. **üêõ Empty Grimoire Auto Layout Crash**
   - **Issue**: Auto layout system crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'topCount')" for empty grimoires
   - **Impact**: System should handle edge cases gracefully
   - **Root Cause**: Auto layout can't generate turn configurations for 0 players

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Fix left side positioning to place players on proper clockwise arc (BUG #7)
- [ ] Implement visual dead player indicators in ASCII rendering (BUG #8)  
- [ ] Investigate and fix token rendering inconsistencies
- [ ] Create test demonstrating layout selection bias from visual formatting (BUG #9)
- [ ] Fix empty grimoire crash with graceful edge case handling
- [ ] Update "completed" status markers to reflect actual working state

**Documentation**: All bugs captured with visual examples in `src/tests/render-grimoire-cases.test.ts`

**Value**: Foundation for grimoire visualization, debugging, and user-friendly state representation

### 2. Performance Optimization ‚úÖ
**Priority**: High  
**Issue**: Role enumeration constraints cause 4000x clause explosion (2K ‚Üí 8.3M clauses)

**RESOLVED**: Sequential counter encoding implemented, reducing constraints from 8.3M to 50K clauses (168x improvement)

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Implement sequential counter encoding for "exactly-N" constraints instead of combinatorial
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate working bag generation with preference constraints
- ‚úÖ Fix physical bag extraction to handle role substitutions correctly

**Future options**:
- [ ] Try Z3 SMT solver backend (has built-in cardinality constraints)
- [ ] Implement hybrid approach: algorithmic role selection + SAT validation
- [ ] Add constraint preprocessing to eliminate redundancies

### 2. Extend DSL Support
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Baron (count modification) + Drunk (physical bag substitution) working

**Add more role types**:
- [ ] Marionette (uses physical bag substitution DSL)
- [ ] Lunatic (uses physical bag substitution DSL)  
- [ ] Other Trouble Brewing roles with setup effects
- [ ] Test complex multi-role interactions

### 3. Bag Generation Improvements ‚úÖ
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Generation mode working with sequential counter optimization

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Fix constraint explosion (sequential counter encoding implemented)
- ‚úÖ Fix physical bag extraction to properly handle role substitutions
- ‚úÖ Add generation preferences ("mustInclude", "mustExclude" constraints)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate logical inference (Drunk + 7 players ‚Üí automatic Baron inclusion)

**Future improvements**:
- [ ] Support roles that might have multiple tokens
- [ ] Add more sophisticated preference mechanisms

### 4. Testing & Validation
**Priority**: Medium  

**Current gaps**:
- [ ] Test all Trouble Brewing role combinations systematically
- [ ] Add property-based testing (generate random valid setups)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking across different player counts
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing with large constraint sets

### 5. Architecture Improvements
**Priority**: Low  

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] Split script-compiler.ts (getting large)
- [ ] Add configuration system for solver backend choice
- [ ] Improve error messages when constraints are unsatisfiable
- [ ] Add debug mode to dump constraint details

## Research Questions

1. **Constraint Encoding Efficiency**
   - Can sequential counters reduce 1,716 ‚Üí ~65 clauses for "5 from 13"?
   - What's the practical limit for role enumeration constraints?

2. **Solver Comparison**
   - How does Z3 perform vs JSMiniSolvers for this domain?
   - Are there SAT solvers optimized for cardinality constraints?

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - What's the break-even point: 1 solve √ó 8M clauses vs N solves √ó 2K clauses?
   - Can we enumerate valid role combinations algorithmically?

## Major Accomplishments ‚úÖ

**Core System**:
- ‚úÖ Implement physical bag substitution DSL (Drunk working)
- ‚úÖ Add clause counting to SAT solver for performance analysis
- ‚úÖ Create dual-mode architecture (validation vs generation)
- ‚úÖ Document constraint explosion findings in research/
- ‚úÖ Test Baron + Drunk combinations working correctly
- ‚úÖ Verify bag legality validation accuracy

**Performance Breakthrough**:
- ‚úÖ Implement sequential counter encoding (168x constraint reduction)
- ‚úÖ Fix constraint explosion from 8.3M to 50K clauses
- ‚úÖ Achieve working bag generation with preferences
- ‚úÖ Create complete generation‚Üíverification cycle
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate logical inference capabilities

**System Integration**:
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with verification
- ‚úÖ Physical bag extraction handling role substitutions correctly
- ‚úÖ Preference-based generation working (mustInclude/mustExclude)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript wrapper for SAT solver with CNF interface

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Remove unused `model` parameter warnings
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Improve CNF clause generation efficiency
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual constraint types
- [ ] **INVESTIGATION**: Inconsistent constraint type definitions between `roles.ts` and actual usage
  - `roles.ts` defines `BagConstraint` interface with complex nested structure
  - Actual role definitions use simplified constraint format with direct `type`, `target`, `delta` fields
  - `trouble-brewing-roles.ts` uses the simpler format exclusively
  - Need to decide: standardize on one approach or support both with proper type safety
- [ ] **CODE ORGANIZATION**: Extract implementation code from test files (TDD artifact cleanup)
  - Multiple test files contain substantial feature implementation
  - Implementation belongs in `src/` modules, not `src/tests/` files
  - Maintain clean separation: tests test behavior, source files contain logic
  - **Example**: `ascii-grimoire.test.ts` contains ~300 lines of rendering implementation

## Strategic Development Directions

### Direction A: Multi-Script Support
**Goal**: Validate DSL generality across BOTC editions
**Priority**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium | **Effort**: High

- [ ] Design grimoire state representation (player assignments, deaths, etc.)
- [ ] Model legal state transitions during gameplay
- [ ] Implement day/night phase validation
- [ ] Add ability validation (when/how abilities can be used)
- [ ] Test complex interaction scenarios (multiple abilities affecting same target)

**Value**: Unlocks full BOTC rule validation, highest practical impact
**Risk**: Significantly more complex problem domain than setup validation

### Direction C: Solution Space Exploration ‚úÖ PROVEN FEASIBLE
**Goal**: Add randomization and variety to generated setups
**Priority**: HIGH | **Risk**: LOW | **Effort**: Medium

**‚úÖ COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ Proved JSMiniSolvers supports blocking clauses for multiple solutions

**üöß IN PROGRESS**:
- [ ] Performance analysis: measure overhead of permutation encoding

**üîÆ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**:
- [ ] Add weighted preferences (slight bias toward/against certain roles)
- [ ] Implement "avoid recent" mode (prefer different roles than last N games)
- [ ] Advanced variety metrics and analysis tools

### 6. Textual Representation Standardization üÜï
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: New requirement identified

**Goal**: Establish standard textual formats for core BOTC game state representations

**Required formats**:
- [ ] **Bag representation**: Standard format for role token collections
  - Physical bag vs in-play distribution
  - Role counts and substitutions
  - Validation status display
- [ ] **Player layout**: Standard format for game seating and player identities
  - Seat positions and player names
  - Alive/dead status
  - Voting eligibility
- [ ] **Grimoire state**: Standard format for complete game state
  - Player character assignments
  - Reminder tokens and their positions
  - Status effects (poisoned, drunk, etc.)
  - Secret information tracking
- [ ] **Events**: Standard format for game state transitions
  - Player actions and ability usage
  - Storyteller information distribution
  - State change documentation
  - Turn/phase tracking

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Human-readable text format
- [ ] Machine-parseable structure
- [ ] Consistent formatting across all tools
- [ ] Support for partial/incomplete information
- [ ] Validation of format correctness

**Impact**: Foundation for grimoire validation, event modeling, and full gameplay state tracking

### 7. Uniform Minion Sampling Validation üî¨
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Research validation experiment

**Goal**: Validate whether our 35% CV represents mathematical reality vs remaining algorithmic bias

**Methodology**:
- [ ] **Enumerate all valid minion combinations** for each player count (7-12)
  - 7 players: [Baron], [Poisoner], [Spy], [Scarlet Woman] (4 combinations)
  - 8+ players: All valid 1-minion and 2-minion combinations
- [ ] **Sample uniformly** from minion combinations (not SAT-solver dependent)
- [ ] **Solve for remaining roles** using SAT constraints to complete each setup
- [ ] **Measure resulting role frequencies** across uniform minion distribution
- [ ] **Compare with constraint matrix results** (Baron: 10.5%, CV: 35.0%)

**Expected Insights**:
- If uniform sampling ‚Üí similar frequencies: Our system achieves near-mathematical optimum
- If uniform sampling ‚Üí higher Baron frequency: Our system still has algorithmic bias
- Establishes ground-truth baseline for "true" BOTC role frequency distribution

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For each player count, enumerate all valid minion combinations
const minionCombos = generateAllValidMinionCombinations(playerCount);
for (const minions of minionCombos) {
    const solution = solveWithFixedMinions(minions);
    // Aggregate frequencies across uniform minion sampling
}
```

**Value**: Validates our bias reduction methods and establishes mathematical baseline for BOTC frequencies

### 8. BDD Alternative Architecture Investigation üî¨
**Priority**: Low (Future Research)  
**Status**: Speculative - current SAT approach works well enough

**Goal**: Investigate Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as alternative to SAT for true uniform sampling

**Motivation**: 
- Current 35.0% CV, while improved, still indicates bias
- BDDs offer native uniform sampling and exact solution counting
- BOTC constraints might have favorable structure for compact BDD representation

**Research Questions**:
- [ ] **Structural analysis**: Do BOTC constraints create compact BDDs despite ~13K variable scope?
- [ ] **Variable reduction**: Can compositional BDD construction reduce effective variable count?
- [ ] **Tool availability**: Are there browser-compatible BDD libraries with adequate performance?
- [ ] **Sampling quality**: Would BDD uniform sampling eliminate our 35% CV bias entirely?

**Experimental Approach**:
- [ ] **Minimal scope test**: 7-player game, Baron + 3-4 other roles
- [ ] **Size measurement**: Compare BDD size to equivalent SAT variable count
- [ ] **Composition validation**: Build modular BDDs and compose via logical operations
- [ ] **Performance comparison**: Time, memory, and sampling quality vs SAT approach

**Favorable Indicators**:
- **Structural redundancy**: Only 2/22 roles (Baron, Drunk) have setup effects
- **Simple arithmetic**: Count modifications are linear (¬±1, ¬±2)
- **Natural sharing**: Common modification patterns and unreachable variable combinations
- **Limited interaction**: Role presence decisions mostly independent

**Risk Mitigation**: 
- Low priority until higher-value tasks completed
- Current SAT approach provides acceptable bias reduction (35% CV vs 47% baseline)
- Bounded experimental scope limits implementation cost

**Value**: Could provide perfect uniform sampling and exact solution counting if BOTC structure proves BDD-favorable

### 9. Web UI Visualization Layer üîÆ
**Priority**: Low (Future)  
**Status**: Long-term enhancement

**Goal**: Rich web interface with interactive visualizations for BOTC game state

**Components**:
- [ ] **Interactive Grimoire Board**: SVG-based game board with drag-and-drop tokens
  - Clickable player seats with status indicators
  - Token placement and movement animations
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Touch-friendly mobile interface
- [ ] **Bag Visualization**: Interactive representation of role token collections
  - Visual diff between physical bag and in-play distribution
  - Drag-and-drop role assignment
  - Validation status with visual indicators
- [ ] **Player Layout Interface**: Interactive seating chart
  - Click to assign players to seats
  - Status indicators (alive/dead, voting eligibility)
  - Player information panels
- [ ] **Event Timeline**: Visual history of game state transitions
  - Chronological event display
  - Click to inspect detailed event information
  - Ability usage tracking and visualization
- [ ] **Storyteller Tools**: Interactive utilities for game management
  - Quick role assignment and validation
  - Information distribution tracking
  - Turn/phase management interface

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Build on standardized textual representation formats
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- [ ] Real-time validation integration
- [ ] Accessibility compliance
- [ ] Touch and mouse interaction support

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of textual representation standardization (Task #6)

**Impact**: Enhanced user experience for storytellers and players, broader tool adoption

**‚úÖ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - SOLUTION SPACE TOPOLOGY MAPPED**:
- ‚úÖ **Constraint Matrix Analysis**: Systematic exploration of solution space via role pair constraints
  - **Scope**: 2,520 trials across all role pairs and player counts 7-12
  - **Success Rate**: 99.4% (2,504/2,520 successful trials)
  - **Performance**: 177s total runtime (70.2ms per trial)
  - **Key Discovery**: Baron appearance follows predictable mathematical patterns:
    - **7 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **8 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **9 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)  
    - **10 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **11 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **12 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)
  - **Pattern**: Baron frequency correlates with base distribution requirements
  - **Role Hierarchy**: Systematic analysis of all role frequencies (Baron rarest at 10.5%, Scarlet Woman most common at 49.2%)
  - **Documented**: Complete analysis in `research/constraint-matrix-analysis.md`
- [ ] **Test Coverage Gap**: Variable indirection system not exercised by existing tests
  - **Option A**: Create new test suite that exercises same scenarios with `useVariableIndirection: true`
  - **Option B**: Make variable indirection always-on by default (use identity permutation or seed=0 when determinism needed)
  - Most existing tests in `src/index.ts` were written before variable indirection and use the old direct approach
  - Need to ensure constraint correctness is maintained across both code paths
  - Decision impacts whether we maintain two modes vs. standardize on indirection
- [ ] **Clean up experimental Baron investigation files**: Many temporary investigation scripts created
  - Review experimental files for permanent value vs temporary debugging
  - Keep useful analysis tools, remove one-off debugging scripts
  - Consolidate learnings into permanent analysis framework

**Value**: ‚úÖ PROVEN - Immediate practical improvement, genuine setup variety
**Risk**: ‚úÖ MITIGATED - Technical feasibility confirmed, bias solution designed

## Long-term Integration Goals

- [ ] Integration with actual BOTC game applications
- [ ] Web UI for interactive bag generation and validation
- [ ] Mobile app integration for storyteller tools

## Documentation and Architecture

- [ ] Split README.md into user-focused goals vs. internal architecture decisions
