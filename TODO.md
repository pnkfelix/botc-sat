# Blood on the Clocktower DSL - TODO List

## Current Status
- **Branch**: `dsl-to-sat-experiment`
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-05
- **Core System**: âœ… Working SAT-based bag validation with Baron & Drunk roles

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization âœ…
**Priority**: High  
**Issue**: Role enumeration constraints cause 4000x clause explosion (2K â†’ 8.3M clauses)

**RESOLVED**: Sequential counter encoding implemented, reducing constraints from 8.3M to 50K clauses (168x improvement)

**Completed**:
- âœ… Implement sequential counter encoding for "exactly-N" constraints instead of combinatorial
- âœ… Demonstrate working bag generation with preference constraints
- âœ… Fix physical bag extraction to handle role substitutions correctly

**Future options**:
- [ ] Try Z3 SMT solver backend (has built-in cardinality constraints)
- [ ] Implement hybrid approach: algorithmic role selection + SAT validation
- [ ] Add constraint preprocessing to eliminate redundancies

### 2. Extend DSL Support
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Baron (count modification) + Drunk (physical bag substitution) working

**Add more role types**:
- [ ] Marionette (uses physical bag substitution DSL)
- [ ] Lunatic (uses physical bag substitution DSL)  
- [ ] Other Trouble Brewing roles with setup effects
- [ ] Test complex multi-role interactions

### 3. Bag Generation Improvements âœ…
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Generation mode working with sequential counter optimization

**Completed**:
- âœ… Fix constraint explosion (sequential counter encoding implemented)
- âœ… Fix physical bag extraction to properly handle role substitutions
- âœ… Add generation preferences ("mustInclude", "mustExclude" constraints)
- âœ… Demonstrate logical inference (Drunk + 7 players â†’ automatic Baron inclusion)

**Future improvements**:
- [ ] Support roles that might have multiple tokens
- [ ] Add more sophisticated preference mechanisms

### 4. Testing & Validation
**Priority**: Medium  

**Current gaps**:
- [ ] Test all Trouble Brewing role combinations systematically
- [ ] Add property-based testing (generate random valid setups)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking across different player counts
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing with large constraint sets

### 5. Architecture Improvements
**Priority**: Low  

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] Split script-compiler.ts (getting large)
- [ ] Add configuration system for solver backend choice
- [ ] Improve error messages when constraints are unsatisfiable
- [ ] Add debug mode to dump constraint details

## Research Questions

1. **Constraint Encoding Efficiency**
   - Can sequential counters reduce 1,716 â†’ ~65 clauses for "5 from 13"?
   - What's the practical limit for role enumeration constraints?

2. **Solver Comparison**
   - How does Z3 perform vs JSMiniSolvers for this domain?
   - Are there SAT solvers optimized for cardinality constraints?

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - What's the break-even point: 1 solve Ã— 8M clauses vs N solves Ã— 2K clauses?
   - Can we enumerate valid role combinations algorithmically?

## Major Accomplishments âœ…

**Core System**:
- âœ… Implement physical bag substitution DSL (Drunk working)
- âœ… Add clause counting to SAT solver for performance analysis
- âœ… Create dual-mode architecture (validation vs generation)
- âœ… Document constraint explosion findings in research/
- âœ… Test Baron + Drunk combinations working correctly
- âœ… Verify bag legality validation accuracy

**Performance Breakthrough**:
- âœ… Implement sequential counter encoding (168x constraint reduction)
- âœ… Fix constraint explosion from 8.3M to 50K clauses
- âœ… Achieve working bag generation with preferences
- âœ… Create complete generationâ†’verification cycle
- âœ… Demonstrate logical inference capabilities

**System Integration**:
- âœ… All tests passing with verification
- âœ… Physical bag extraction handling role substitutions correctly
- âœ… Preference-based generation working (mustInclude/mustExclude)
- âœ… TypeScript wrapper for SAT solver with CNF interface

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Remove unused `model` parameter warnings
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Improve CNF clause generation efficiency
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual constraint types
- [ ] **INVESTIGATION**: Inconsistent constraint type definitions between `roles.ts` and actual usage
  - `roles.ts` defines `BagConstraint` interface with complex nested structure
  - Actual role definitions use simplified constraint format with direct `type`, `target`, `delta` fields
  - `trouble-brewing-roles.ts` uses the simpler format exclusively
  - Need to decide: standardize on one approach or support both with proper type safety

## Strategic Development Directions

### Direction A: Multi-Script Support
**Goal**: Validate DSL generality across BOTC editions
**Priority**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium | **Effort**: High

- [ ] Implement Sects & Violets script and role definitions
- [ ] Implement Bad Moon Rising script and role definitions  
- [ ] Test constraint system with different role mechanics (Madness, etc.)
- [ ] Validate that current architecture scales to other editions
- [ ] Document any DSL extensions needed for new mechanics

**Value**: Proves system generality, enables broader BOTC support
**Risk**: May discover fundamental limitations requiring architecture changes

### Direction B: Grimoire Validation  
**Goal**: Move from setup validation to gameplay state validation
**Priority**: High | **Risk**: High | **Effort**: Very High

- [ ] Design grimoire state representation (player assignments, deaths, etc.)
- [ ] Model legal state transitions during gameplay
- [ ] Implement day/night phase validation
- [ ] Add ability validation (when/how abilities can be used)
- [ ] Test complex interaction scenarios (multiple abilities affecting same target)

**Value**: Unlocks full BOTC rule validation, highest practical impact
**Risk**: Significantly more complex problem domain than setup validation

### Direction C: Solution Space Exploration âœ… PROVEN FEASIBLE
**Goal**: Add randomization and variety to generated setups
**Priority**: HIGH | **Risk**: LOW | **Effort**: Medium

**âœ… COMPLETED**:
- âœ… Proved JSMiniSolvers supports blocking clauses for multiple solutions
- âœ… Implemented `generateMultipleLegalBags()` with variety generation

- âœ… Test bias reduction effectiveness with slot-based variable assignment
- âœ… Validate that indirection preserves constraint correctness
- âœ… Create generalized seed analysis system for deterministic testing
- âœ… Generate 1000 random seeds with improved bit-pattern variation
- âœ… Compare sequential vs random seed bias patterns (6.9% CV improvement)
- âœ… Document bias reduction findings and analysis framework

**ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS**:
- [ ] Performance analysis: measure overhead of permutation encoding

**ðŸ”® FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**:
- [ ] Add weighted preferences (slight bias toward/against certain roles)
- [ ] Implement "avoid recent" mode (prefer different roles than last N games)
- [ ] Advanced variety metrics and analysis tools

### 6. Textual Representation Standardization ðŸ†•
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: New requirement identified

**Goal**: Establish standard textual formats for core BOTC game state representations

  - Physical bag vs in-play distribution
  - Role counts and substitutions
  - Validation status display
- [ ] **Player layout**: Standard format for game seating and player identities
  - Seat positions and player names
  - Alive/dead status
  - Voting eligibility
- [ ] **Grimoire state**: Standard format for complete game state
  - Player character assignments
  - Reminder tokens and their positions
  - Status effects (poisoned, drunk, etc.)
  - Secret information tracking
- [ ] **Events**: Standard format for game state transitions

**Impact**: Foundation for grimoire validation, event modeling, and full gameplay state tracking

### 7. Uniform Minion Sampling Validation ðŸ”¬
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Research validation experiment

**Goal**: Validate whether our 35% CV represents mathematical reality vs remaining algorithmic bias

**Methodology**:
- [ ] **Enumerate all valid minion combinations** for each player count (7-12)
  - 7 players: [Baron], [Poisoner], [Spy], [Scarlet Woman] (4 combinations)
  - 8+ players: All valid 1-minion and 2-minion combinations
- [ ] **Sample uniformly** from minion combinations (not SAT-solver dependent)
- [ ] **Solve for remaining roles** using SAT constraints to complete each setup
- [ ] **Measure resulting role frequencies** across uniform minion distribution
- [ ] **Compare with constraint matrix results** (Baron: 10.5%, CV: 35.0%)

**Expected Insights**:
- If uniform sampling â†’ similar frequencies: Our system achieves near-mathematical optimum
- If uniform sampling â†’ higher Baron frequency: Our system still has algorithmic bias
- Establishes ground-truth baseline for "true" BOTC role frequency distribution

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For each player count, enumerate all valid minion combinations
const minionCombos = generateAllValidMinionCombinations(playerCount);
for (const minions of minionCombos) {
    const solution = solveWithFixedMinions(minions);
    // Aggregate frequencies across uniform minion sampling
}
```

**Value**: Validates our bias reduction methods and establishes mathematical baseline for BOTC frequencies

### 8. Web UI Visualization Layer ðŸ”®

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of textual representation standardization (Task #6)

**Impact**: Enhanced user experience for storytellers and players, broader tool adoption

**âœ… MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - SOLUTION SPACE TOPOLOGY MAPPED**:
- âœ… **Constraint Matrix Analysis**: Systematic exploration of solution space via role pair constraints
  - **Scope**: 2,520 trials across all role pairs and player counts 7-12
  - **Success Rate**: 99.4% (2,504/2,520 successful trials)
  - **Performance**: 177s total runtime (70.2ms per trial)
  - **Key Discovery**: Baron appearance follows predictable mathematical patterns:
    - **7 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **8 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **9 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)  
    - **10 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **11 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **12 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)
  - **Pattern**: Baron frequency correlates with base distribution requirements
  - **Role Hierarchy**: Systematic analysis of all role frequencies (Baron rarest at 10.5%, Scarlet Woman most common at 49.2%)
  - **Documented**: Complete analysis in `research/constraint-matrix-analysis.md`
- [ ] **Test Coverage Gap**: Variable indirection system not exercised by existing tests
  - **Option A**: Create new test suite that exercises same scenarios with `useVariableIndirection: true`
  - **Option B**: Make variable indirection always-on by default (use identity permutation or seed=0 when determinism needed)
  - Most existing tests in `src/index.ts` were written before variable indirection and use the old direct approach
  - Need to ensure constraint correctness is maintained across both code paths
  - Decision impacts whether we maintain two modes vs. standardize on indirection
- [ ] **Clean up experimental Baron investigation files**: Many temporary investigation scripts created
  - Review experimental files for permanent value vs temporary debugging
  - Keep useful analysis tools, remove one-off debugging scripts
  - Consolidate learnings into permanent analysis framework

**Value**: âœ… PROVEN - Immediate practical improvement, genuine setup variety
**Risk**: âœ… MITIGATED - Technical feasibility confirmed, bias solution designed
