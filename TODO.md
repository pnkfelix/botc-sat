# Blood on the Clocktower DSL - TODO List

## Current Status
- **Main Branch**: `main` - stable SAT-based bag validation system
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/ascii-grimoire-hybrid-spacing` - ASCII grimoire rendering development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-26
- **Core System**: ‚úÖ Working SAT-based bag validation with Baron & Drunk roles
- **New Feature**: ‚úÖ ASCII grimoire rendering with hybrid spacing algorithm and role abbreviations
- **Recent Completions**: ‚úÖ Constraint-based layout modes, validation systems, integration testing

## üö® HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES, REGRESSIONS & IMPLEMENTATION GAPS

**Status**: 1 critical issue remaining plus new validation concerns identified.

### Edge Case Handling
1. **üêõ Empty Grimoire Auto Layout Crash**
   - **Issue**: Auto layout system crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'topCount')" for empty grimoires
   - **Impact**: System should handle edge cases gracefully
   - **Root Cause**: Auto layout can't generate turn configurations for 0 players
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### Validation System Issues  
2. **üêõ Column Validation False Positives**
   - **Issue**: Validation incorrectly identifies single-word roles (imp, spy, chef) as player names due to flawed heuristic
   - **Root Cause**: Logic assumes all roles have underscores, but many don't (imp, spy, chef vs fortune_teller, scarlet_woman)
   - **Examples**: "*Charlie:imp*" triggers warning "Column 40: [*Charlie*, *imp*]" because both are misclassified as player names
   - **Impact**: False positive warnings that confuse developers - actual layout positioning is correct
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM (cosmetic issue, not functional bug)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Fix empty grimoire crash with graceful edge case handling - **ACTIVE HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] Fix column validation false positives - rewrite player name detection logic to avoid misclassifying single-word roles

**Documentation**: All bugs captured with visual examples in `src/tests/render-grimoire-cases.test.ts`

## üéâ RECENTLY RESOLVED HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES

**Major Progress**: 4 of 5 original critical issues successfully resolved with comprehensive test coverage.

### ASCII Grimoire Rendering Issues - RESOLVED
**Test Coverage**: `src/tests/render-grimoire-cases.test.ts`

1. **‚úÖ FIXED: Layout Selection Affected by Visual Formatting (BUG #9)**
   - **Issue**: Auto layout selection changed based on visual formatting (dead indicators, etc.) rather than logical structure
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive tests (7-15 players) demonstrate "perfect border stability"
   - **Test Coverage**: Lines 329-714 with systematic alive/dead layout comparisons

2. **‚úÖ FIXED: Token Rendering Inconsistency (BUG #2)**
   - **Issue**: Some tokens not appearing in rendered output (Alice's `ww:townsfolk` missing while Bob's `lib:outsider` shows)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Both tokens now render correctly in bubble column system
   - **Test Case**: `[Alice:washerwoman(ww:townsfolk) Bob:librarian(lib:outsider) *Charlie:imp*]`

3. **‚úÖ FIXED: Left Side Positioning (BUG #7)**
   - **Issue**: Left side players appeared below bottom row instead of proper clockwise arc
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Proper coordinate calculations implemented

4. **‚úÖ FIXED: Dead Player Visual Indicators (BUG #8)**
   - **Issue**: Dead players showed no visual indication in ASCII output
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Consistent visual formatting between single-line and ASCII formats

- [ ] Implement hybrid approach: algorithmic role selection + SAT validation
- [ ] Add constraint preprocessing to eliminate redundancies

### 2. Extend DSL Support
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Baron (count modification) + Drunk (physical bag substitution) working

**Add more role types**:
- [ ] Marionette (uses physical bag substitution DSL)
- [ ] Lunatic (uses physical bag substitution DSL)  
- [ ] Other Trouble Brewing roles with setup effects
- [ ] Test complex multi-role interactions

### 3. Bag Generation Improvements ‚úÖ
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current**: Generation mode working with sequential counter optimization

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Fix constraint explosion (sequential counter encoding implemented)
- ‚úÖ Fix physical bag extraction to properly handle role substitutions
- ‚úÖ Add generation preferences ("mustInclude", "mustExclude" constraints)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate logical inference (Drunk + 7 players ‚Üí automatic Baron inclusion)

**Future improvements**:
- [ ] Support roles that might have multiple tokens
- [ ] Add more sophisticated preference mechanisms

### 4. Testing & Validation
**Priority**: Medium  

**‚úÖ Recently Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **Examples integration testing** - automated validation that all example files execute without errors
- ‚úÖ **Documentation consistency** - validates examples match README documentation
- ‚úÖ **Deprecated API detection** - prevents deployment of outdated example code
- ‚úÖ **Column uniqueness validation** - ensures ASCII grimoire rendering meets layout constraints

**Current gaps**:
- [ ] Test all Trouble Brewing role combinations systematically

- [ ] Performance benchmarking across different player counts
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing with large constraint sets

### 5. Architecture Improvements
**Priority**: Low  

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] Split script-compiler.ts (getting large)
- [ ] Add configuration system for solver backend choice
- [ ] Improve error messages when constraints are unsatisfiable
- [ ] Add debug mode to dump constraint details

## Research Questions

1. **Constraint Encoding Efficiency**
   - Can sequential counters reduce 1,716 ‚Üí ~65 clauses for "5 from 13"?
   - What's the practical limit for role enumeration constraints?

2. **Solver Comparison**
   - How does Z3 perform vs JSMiniSolvers for this domain?
   - Are there SAT solvers optimized for cardinality constraints?

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - What's the break-even point: 1 solve √ó 8M clauses vs N solves √ó 2K clauses?
   - Can we enumerate valid role combinations algorithmically?

## Major Accomplishments ‚úÖ

**Core System**:
- ‚úÖ Implement physical bag substitution DSL (Drunk working)
- ‚úÖ Add clause counting to SAT solver for performance analysis
- ‚úÖ Create dual-mode architecture (validation vs generation)
- ‚úÖ Document constraint explosion findings in research/
- ‚úÖ Test Baron + Drunk combinations working correctly
- ‚úÖ Verify bag legality validation accuracy

**Performance Breakthrough**:
- ‚úÖ Implement sequential counter encoding (168x constraint reduction)
- ‚úÖ Fix constraint explosion from 8.3M to 50K clauses
- ‚úÖ Achieve working bag generation with preferences
- ‚úÖ Create complete generation‚Üíverification cycle
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate logical inference capabilities

**System Integration**:
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with verification
- ‚úÖ Physical bag extraction handling role substitutions correctly
- ‚úÖ Preference-based generation working (mustInclude/mustExclude)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript wrapper for SAT solver with CNF interface

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Remove unused `model` parameter warnings
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Improve CNF clause generation efficiency
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual constraint types
- [ ] **INVESTIGATION**: Inconsistent constraint type definitions between `roles.ts` and actual usage
  - `roles.ts` defines `BagConstraint` interface with complex nested structure
  - Actual role definitions use simplified constraint format with direct `type`, `target`, `delta` fields
  - `trouble-brewing-roles.ts` uses the simpler format exclusively
  - Need to decide: standardize on one approach or support both with proper type safety
- [ ] **CODE ORGANIZATION**: Extract implementation code from test files (TDD artifact cleanup)
  - Multiple test files contain substantial feature implementation
  - Implementation belongs in `src/` modules, not `src/tests/` files
  - Maintain clean separation: tests test behavior, source files contain logic
  - **Example**: `ascii-grimoire.test.ts` contains ~300 lines of rendering implementation

## Strategic Development Directions

### Direction A: Multi-Script Support
**Goal**: Validate DSL generality across BOTC editions
**Priority**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium | **Effort**: High

- [ ] Implement Sects & Violets script and role definitions
- [ ] Implement Bad Moon Rising script and role definitions  
- [ ] Test constraint system with different role mechanics (Madness, etc.)
- [ ] Validate that current architecture scales to other editions

- [ ] Design grimoire state representation (player assignments, deaths, etc.)
- [ ] Model legal state transitions during gameplay
- [ ] Implement day/night phase validation
- [ ] Add ability validation (when/how abilities can be used)
- [ ] Test complex interaction scenarios (multiple abilities affecting same target)

**Value**: Unlocks full BOTC rule validation, highest practical impact
**Risk**: Significantly more complex problem domain than setup validation

### Direction C: Solution Space Exploration ‚úÖ PROVEN FEASIBLE
**Goal**: Add randomization and variety to generated setups
**Priority**: HIGH | **Risk**: LOW | **Effort**: Medium

**‚úÖ COMPLETED**:
- ‚úÖ Proved JSMiniSolvers supports blocking clauses for multiple solutions
- ‚úÖ Implemented `generateMultipleLegalBags()` with variety generation
- ‚úÖ Identified systematic bias due to VSIDS variable ordering heuristics
- ‚úÖ Designed variable indirection solution to eliminate bias

**‚úÖ COMPLETED**:

- ‚úÖ Test bias reduction effectiveness with slot-based variable assignment
- ‚úÖ Validate that indirection preserves constraint correctness
- ‚úÖ Create generalized seed analysis system for deterministic testing
- ‚úÖ Generate 1000 random seeds with improved bit-pattern variation
- ‚úÖ Compare sequential vs random seed bias patterns (6.9% CV improvement)
- ‚úÖ Document bias reduction findings and analysis framework

**üöß IN PROGRESS**:
- [ ] Performance analysis: measure overhead of permutation encoding

**üîÆ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**:
- [ ] Add weighted preferences (slight bias toward/against certain roles)
- [ ] Implement "avoid recent" mode (prefer different roles than last N games)
- [ ] Advanced variety metrics and analysis tools

### 6. Textual Representation Standardization üÜï
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: New requirement identified

**Goal**: Establish standard textual formats for core BOTC game state representations

**Required formats**:
- [ ] **Bag representation**: Standard format for role token collections
  - Physical bag vs in-play distribution
  - Role counts and substitutions
  - Validation status display
- [ ] **Player layout**: Standard format for game seating and player identities
  - Seat positions and player names
  - Alive/dead status
  - Voting eligibility
- [ ] **Grimoire state**: Standard format for complete game state
  - Player character assignments
  - Reminder tokens and their positions
  - Status effects (poisoned, drunk, etc.)
  - Secret information tracking
- [ ] **Events**: Standard format for game state transitions
  - Player actions and ability usage
  - Storyteller information distribution
  - State change documentation
  - Turn/phase tracking

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Human-readable text format
- [ ] Machine-parseable structure
- [ ] Consistent formatting across all tools
- [ ] Support for partial/incomplete information
- [ ] Validation of format correctness

**Impact**: Foundation for grimoire validation, event modeling, and full gameplay state tracking

### 7. Uniform Minion Sampling Validation üî¨
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Research validation experiment

**Goal**: Validate whether our 35% CV represents mathematical reality vs remaining algorithmic bias

**Methodology**:
- [ ] **Enumerate all valid minion combinations** for each player count (7-12)
  - 7 players: [Baron], [Poisoner], [Spy], [Scarlet Woman] (4 combinations)
  - 8+ players: All valid 1-minion and 2-minion combinations
- [ ] **Sample uniformly** from minion combinations (not SAT-solver dependent)
- [ ] **Solve for remaining roles** using SAT constraints to complete each setup
- [ ] **Measure resulting role frequencies** across uniform minion distribution
- [ ] **Compare with constraint matrix results** (Baron: 10.5%, CV: 35.0%)

**Expected Insights**:
- If uniform sampling ‚Üí similar frequencies: Our system achieves near-mathematical optimum
- If uniform sampling ‚Üí higher Baron frequency: Our system still has algorithmic bias
- Establishes ground-truth baseline for "true" BOTC role frequency distribution

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For each player count, enumerate all valid minion combinations
const minionCombos = generateAllValidMinionCombinations(playerCount);
for (const minions of minionCombos) {
    const solution = solveWithFixedMinions(minions);
    // Aggregate frequencies across uniform minion sampling
}
```

**Value**: Validates our bias reduction methods and establishes mathematical baseline for BOTC frequencies

### 8. BDD Alternative Architecture Investigation üî¨
**Priority**: Low (Future Research)  
**Status**: Speculative - current SAT approach works well enough

**Goal**: Investigate Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as alternative to SAT for true uniform sampling

**Motivation**: 
- Current 35.0% CV, while improved, still indicates bias
- BDDs offer native uniform sampling and exact solution counting
- BOTC constraints might have favorable structure for compact BDD representation

**Research Questions**:
- [ ] **Structural analysis**: Do BOTC constraints create compact BDDs despite ~13K variable scope?
- [ ] **Variable reduction**: Can compositional BDD construction reduce effective variable count?
- [ ] **Tool availability**: Are there browser-compatible BDD libraries with adequate performance?
- [ ] **Sampling quality**: Would BDD uniform sampling eliminate our 35% CV bias entirely?

**Experimental Approach**:
- [ ] **Minimal scope test**: 7-player game, Baron + 3-4 other roles
- [ ] **Size measurement**: Compare BDD size to equivalent SAT variable count
- [ ] **Composition validation**: Build modular BDDs and compose via logical operations
- [ ] **Performance comparison**: Time, memory, and sampling quality vs SAT approach

**Favorable Indicators**:
- **Structural redundancy**: Only 2/22 roles (Baron, Drunk) have setup effects
- **Simple arithmetic**: Count modifications are linear (¬±1, ¬±2)
- **Natural sharing**: Common modification patterns and unreachable variable combinations
- **Limited interaction**: Role presence decisions mostly independent

**Risk Mitigation**: 
- Low priority until higher-value tasks completed
- Current SAT approach provides acceptable bias reduction (35% CV vs 47% baseline)
- Bounded experimental scope limits implementation cost

**Value**: Could provide perfect uniform sampling and exact solution counting if BOTC structure proves BDD-favorable

### 9. Web UI Visualization Layer üîÆ
**Priority**: Low (Future)  
**Status**: Long-term enhancement

**Goal**: Rich web interface with interactive visualizations for BOTC game state

**Components**:
- [ ] **Interactive Grimoire Board**: SVG-based game board with drag-and-drop tokens
  - Clickable player seats with status indicators
  - Token placement and movement animations
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Touch-friendly mobile interface
- [ ] **Bag Visualization**: Interactive representation of role token collections
  - Visual diff between physical bag and in-play distribution
  - Drag-and-drop role assignment
  - Validation status with visual indicators
- [ ] **Player Layout Interface**: Interactive seating chart
  - Click to assign players to seats
  - Status indicators (alive/dead, voting eligibility)
  - Player information panels
- [ ] **Event Timeline**: Visual history of game state transitions
  - Chronological event display
  - Click to inspect detailed event information
  - Ability usage tracking and visualization
- [ ] **Storyteller Tools**: Interactive utilities for game management
  - Quick role assignment and validation
  - Information distribution tracking
  - Turn/phase management interface

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Build on standardized textual representation formats
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- [ ] Real-time validation integration
- [ ] Accessibility compliance
- [ ] Touch and mouse interaction support

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of textual representation standardization (Task #6)

**Impact**: Enhanced user experience for storytellers and players, broader tool adoption

**‚úÖ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - SOLUTION SPACE TOPOLOGY MAPPED**:
- ‚úÖ **Constraint Matrix Analysis**: Systematic exploration of solution space via role pair constraints
  - **Scope**: 2,520 trials across all role pairs and player counts 7-12
  - **Success Rate**: 99.4% (2,504/2,520 successful trials)
  - **Performance**: 177s total runtime (70.2ms per trial)
  - **Key Discovery**: Baron appearance follows predictable mathematical patterns:
    - **7 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **8 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **9 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)  
    - **10 players**: 23.1% Baron frequency (HIGH)
    - **11 players**: 4.8% Baron frequency (low)
    - **12 players**: 3.8% Baron frequency (low)
  - **Pattern**: Baron frequency correlates with base distribution requirements
  - **Role Hierarchy**: Systematic analysis of all role frequencies (Baron rarest at 10.5%, Scarlet Woman most common at 49.2%)
  - **Documented**: Complete analysis in `research/constraint-matrix-analysis.md`
- [ ] **Test Coverage Gap**: Variable indirection system not exercised by existing tests
  - **Option A**: Create new test suite that exercises same scenarios with `useVariableIndirection: true`
  - **Option B**: Make variable indirection always-on by default (use identity permutation or seed=0 when determinism needed)
  - Most existing tests in `src/index.ts` were written before variable indirection and use the old direct approach
  - Need to ensure constraint correctness is maintained across both code paths
  - Decision impacts whether we maintain two modes vs. standardize on indirection
- [ ] **Clean up experimental Baron investigation files**: Many temporary investigation scripts created
  - Review experimental files for permanent value vs temporary debugging
  - Keep useful analysis tools, remove one-off debugging scripts
  - Consolidate learnings into permanent analysis framework

**Value**: ‚úÖ PROVEN - Immediate practical improvement, genuine setup variety
**Risk**: ‚úÖ MITIGATED - Technical feasibility confirmed, bias solution designed

## Recently Completed ‚úÖ

### ASCII Grimoire Rendering Fixes
**Completed**: 2025-07-20

1. **‚úÖ BUG #7: Left Side Positioning - FIXED**
   - **Issue**: Left side players appeared below bottom row instead of on proper clockwise arc
   - **Solution**: Fixed coordinate calculations in `src/rendering/ascii-grimoire.ts` - bottom players now positioned below left players to avoid row conflicts
   - **Test Case**: 6-player `[Alice:investigator Bob:chef Charlie:empath Dave:librarian Eve:butler *Frank:imp*]`
   - **Result**: ‚úÖ Proper clockwise arc: Alice (top) ‚Üí Bob (right) ‚Üí Dave/Charlie (bottom) ‚Üí Frank/Eve (left)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All tests passing, visual inspection confirms correct layout

2. **‚úÖ BUG #8: Dead Player Visual Indicators - FIXED**
